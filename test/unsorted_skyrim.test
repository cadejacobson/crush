Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, 
right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that
thief over there.
Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was
nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen
that horse and been half way to Hammerfell. You there. You and me -- we
should be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.
We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.
Imperial Soldier: Shut up back there!
[Lokir looks at the gagged man.]
And what's wrong with him?
Watch your tongue! You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High
King.
Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if
they captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us?
I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits.
