Crush (AKA Cade's Rust SHell) is a rust implementation of a modern shell! This will (soon) have all the features
you expect from your favorite CLI. Currently, we are working on our takeoff.

## Installing Rust

To install Rust see here: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

## Building the Project

Building this project can be done by going to the base of the repository in the CLI and entering the command
`cargo build`. This project currently only contains the singular binary, so `cargo run` will activate the shell.
